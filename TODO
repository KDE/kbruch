what is left to do
==================

	* maybe use int instead of short because source easier to read

	* maybe split class task in representation, calculate and generation

	* (integrate KBruch as part into KMath -> KMath isn't maintained at the
	   moment)

===============

- a visual representation of fractions in circles, rectangeles, ... for
beginners
- the possibility to practic conversions from fractions to decimal numbers and
vica versa.  1/8 = 0.125
- the calculation with 'mixed numbers' like  2 1/3 + 5 1/7 =
- train actions like   1/3 = 3/9 or   15/45 = 1/3. I don't know the Englisch
words for this actions.

there's also an algorithm to convert decimal numbers of infinite
length, but with a repeating part ( which means the decimal
representations of all rational numbers ) into fractions...  I think
the idea was to divide the repeating part by a number which you write
down as x 9's where x is the length of the repeating part ( that's the
best i can explain it in english :). E.g. 0,111... would become 1/9
.  0.1212... would become 12/99 etc.  This is the way they explained
it to us in high school, i'm sure there's an easy way to write this
down in code...

With a being your periodical decimal number and n being the length of the
period, you multiply a by 10^n and then subtract a:

a = 0.1111111

10a = 1.1111111

9a = 1
a = 1 / 9

b = 0.213213213213
1000b = 213.213213213213
999b = 213
b = 213 / 999
